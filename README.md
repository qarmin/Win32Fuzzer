# Win32 Fuzzer

This repository contains fuzzer to test Windows API functions(Win32 API).

I created it to help Wine to better mimic Windows OS and allow running more Windows software on Linux. 

Looks that currently tests - Classes: "165", Functions: "10540", Arguments: "35174"

## TODO
- Add settings
- Add random execution
